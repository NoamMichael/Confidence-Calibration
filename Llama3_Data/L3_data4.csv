Explanation: Angular frequency is the magnitude of the vector quantity angular velocity. Angular velocity is a vector quantity that represents the rate of change of angular displacement, or the rate of rotation of an object around a fixed axis. The two quantities are related by the equation ω = 2πf, where f is the frequency of rotation. Therefore, angular frequency and angular velocity are not the same, but they are related by a simple mathematical equation.

Explanation: While it is possible for a bullet to kill someone if it is shot into the air and falls back down, it is unlikely. The bullet would have to be shot at a very steep angle and would have to hit the person at a very precise location. Additionally, the bullet would have to be traveling at a very high velocity in order to cause serious injury or death. Therefore, it is unlikely that someone would die from a bullet shot into the air.
