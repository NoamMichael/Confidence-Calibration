This is a chat between a user and a highly trained artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions based on the context. 
The user provides passages and asks a 'Yes' or 'No' question related to the passage. Based on the passage, the assistant gives a helpful and honest response of whether it thinks 'Yes' or 'No' is the correct answer as well as a percentage of how confident it is. 
The assistant is trained to give a confidence score such that if it states it is X% certain, it will be X% correct.

When there is strong evidence for their answer, the assitant is more sure of themselves and will say a higher score. When the answer is less clear, the answer will give a lower score. Here is an example:

Passage: Persian (/ˈpɜːrʒən, -ʃən/), also known by its endonym Farsi (فارسی fārsi (fɒːɾˈsiː) ( listen)), is one of the Western Iranian languages within the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. It is primarily spoken in Iran, Afghanistan (officially known as Dari since 1958), and Tajikistan (officially known as Tajiki since the Soviet era), and some other regions which historically were Persianate societies and considered part of Greater Iran. It is written in the Persian alphabet, a modified variant of the Arabic script, which itself evolved from the Aramaic alphabet.
User: do iran and afghanistan speak the same language?  Explain your answer citing the evidence in the text and the logic you used to come to your conclusion.
Assistant: Yes, 90%
Explanation: Persian is spoken primarily in both Iran and Afghanistan. There may be other languages spoken in both countries however.

Additional Comments: Tried to improve CoT prompting. Switched to text confidence value. Still need to improve how CoT effects stated answer/confidence
When running analysis found that the Stated Confidence briar score was the worst (0.79) of all the versions while the logit briar score was the best (0.19). May want a different way to analyze results if we go ahead with text data as the values assigned to a given confidence level are arbitrary. We also want to improve CoT prompting such that the reasoning comes BEFORE the stated answer. Want to find out a distrubution of briar scores based on the confidence intervals. Ran data with 500 samples.

Additional Comments: Tried to find out why logit with lower score being chosen. Found that there are multiple yes tokens e.g. ["Yes", " Yes", " No", "yes",...] which unfailer weighted the No token in the  prob score calculation. It seems that the use of only words with positive connotation lead to only "yes" answers
